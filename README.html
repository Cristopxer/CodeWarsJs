<h3><b>What's CodeWars?</b></h3>
<p>Codewars is where developers achieve code mastery through challenge. Train on kata in the dojo and reach your highest potential.</p>
<h3>Where is the magic?</h3>
<p>Basically I started to learn Javascript a few weeks ago and this repo is to record my progress.</p>
<p>In the ExcercisesJS folder (I'd change the name to Kata ðŸ˜…) are the solutions of the differentes katas, also the kata description is commented in the exercise.</p>
